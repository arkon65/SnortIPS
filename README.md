# SnortIPS
SnortIPS is a python script I developed for my undergraduate thesis. 
It serves as an IPS for any type of network, from legacy to SDN, 
using a combination of Python libraries, Snort IDS/IPS software and iptable commands.

It used the simple logic of scraping CMD outputs from Snort and using them to activate firewall rules, 
in order to function as a IPS in any system.

Snort and any of the libraries I utilize in my script, were not developed by me. 
The SnortIPS script was developed by me, utilizing all the mentioned libraries and software.
