# SnortIPS
SnortIPS is a python script I developed for my undergraduate thesis. 
It serves as an IPS for any type of network, from legacy to SDN, 
using a combination of Python libraries, Snort IDS/IPS software and iptable commands.

The idea behind it is to scrape CMD outputs from Snort and using them to activate firewall rules, 
in order to function as a IPS in any system.

In this repository, you will find the python script, which is standalone, and a small user manual, which I will try to improve as time passes by. 
Feel free to pinpoint any tips or issues, I will be glad to consider them and implement them in my code.

Thank you, enjoy.


**Disclaimer: Snort and any of the libraries I utilize, in my script, were not developed by me. 
The SnortIPS script was developed by me, utilizing all the included libraries and software.
